# UX/UI Design Project for Cuyana

## Introduction
This repository contains the UX/UI design work I completed for Cuyana, focused on crafting an elegant and user-friendly e-commerce experience. The designs aim to streamline the shopping process while maintaining the aesthetic and values of the brand.

## Project Overview
Cuyana stands for sustainable fashion, and this design project was an effort to embody that ethos in a digital format. The project deliverables include a full PDF overview, along with individual design files for both mobile and desktop versions.
